# Ideas List
- Systems have chance for no planets to spawn, just  star.
- Generate stars in systems.
- Stars have temperature and size values.
- Advanced planet generation: generate planet types based of distance from star and sizes.
- Load in planet types from file?
- Define what makes a planet type (temp, composition), assign planet types based off those values.
